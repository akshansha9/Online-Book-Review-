In this representation:

- Each table corresponds to an entity in the ER diagram.
- Primary keys (PK) uniquely identify each record.
- Foreign keys (FK) establish relationships between tables.

Here are the relationships:

- The `User` table has a one-to-many relationship with both `Rating` and `Comment` tables.
- The `Book` table also has a one-to-many relationship with both `Rating` and `Comment` tables.
- The `Rating` and `Comment` tables have foreign keys (`userID` and `bookID`) referencing the `User` and `Book` tables, respectively.
